# The Server

The simplest way to install this server is to click the button below; you’ll be redirected to Heroku, where a simple page will instruct you on how to install the app. This approach is simple to the point where even the environment variables are going to be created automatically for you.

An important part of this step is the final process, in which you have two buttons at the end of the page. The important one is named “View”. Click on it to launch the welcome page and get access to your auto-generated API KEY and the app's URL.
